--> Basic Commands :

1. Check Version

   pig -version

2. Run Pic in local mode

   pig -x local

3. Run pig in cluster mode

   pig

--> Pig Data Models :

1. Tuple 
 
  --> Ordered set of fields
  --> May contain diffrent data types for each fields
  --> Example : (1,Nishi,2,Alisha)

2. Bag

  --> Collection of tuples
  --> These tuples could be subset of the row or entire rows of the table
  --> Example : {(1,Nishi,2,Alisha),(3,Adnan,4,Nupur)}

3. Map

  --> Key-value pairs used to represent data elements
  --> Before # -> key
  --> After  # -> value
  --> Key can not be duplicate but value can be duplicate.
  --> id # 1, name # Nishi, city # surat, state # Gujarat
	
4. Atom

--> Basic datatypes
--> Like string, int, float, long, double, char[], byte[]

--> Pig Operators

1. LOAD : load data from the local file system / HDFS to Pig

2. FOREACH : Generates data transformations based on columns or data

3. FILTER : Selects tuple from a relation based on the condition 

4. JOIN : Joins the relations based on the columns

5. ORDER BY : Sorts the relations based on one or more fileds

6. STORE : Saves the result on the local file system or HDFS

7. DISTINCT : Remove duplicate tuple from the relationship

8. GROUP : Group together a tuple with the same group key

9. COCROUP : It is similar to GROUP. But COGROUP is used when multiple relations re involved


*************************************************************************

--> LOAD Command

  student = LOAD 'hdfs://localhost:9000/Pig_Data/Student' USING PigStorage(',') as (id:int, firstname:chararray, lastname:chararray, phone:chararray, city:chararray );

--> Dump Command ( Print Loaded data on the screen )

  dump student;

--> FOREACH Command 

    student_foreach = foreach student generate(firstname,city);
    
    dump student_foreach;

--> FILTER Command 

     student_filter = filter student by city == 'Pune';

     dump student_filter;

--> ORDER BY Command

    student_order = order student by id desc;

    dump student_order;

--> STORE Command ( stores generated object to hdfs )

    STORE student_foreach into '/Pig_Data/student_foreach';
